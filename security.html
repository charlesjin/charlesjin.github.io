          Tumblr was broken, and all it took was the first two pages of Javascript 101.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          To be more specific, Tumblr's javascript sanitization system for content input was broken. Last week, Frank and I were designing a simple blogging feature for our product where musicians would be able to create a post and then have it displayed on their websites. We thought that they would very likely want to embed Youtube videos, Soundcloud content, Vimeo uploads, and other media into their blog posts. There seemed to be a trade-off: don't sanitize and allow all scripts to run, or sanitize and nothing gets through.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Neither of these seemed like good options, so we decided to investigate other websites and see how they handled this same issue.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <b>Wordpress and Tumblr were our first suspects and to our surprise, we found that both sites allowed users to embed whatever they wanted without sanitizing any of the content.</b>
        </div>
        <h2> Sanitize Me Bro: Javascript </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          To reproduce these exploits, literally all you had to do was log into tumblr, and create a post. Click the option for "html" and type the following in: 
          <div class="code">
            &lt;script&gt;alert("Hello World!")&lt;/script&gt;
          </div>
          And that's it! (Before Tumblr patches things up, <b><a href="http://sanitizemebro.tumblr.com" target="_blank"> this link </a></b>could show you what happens.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Here's the weird part: Tumblr actually wrapped all the text inside the script tags inside a CDATA section. CDATA stands for "Character Data", which actually <i>helps</i> a hacker trying to inject malicious javascript into a post. Normal javascript has random characters in it that will screw with an XML parser (i.e. what is translating the source code of a webpage into what your browser is rendering). So it seems like Tumblr actually just never thought someone would try to embed javascript into a post.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Who cares, you might think. Anyone could set up an annoying alert box on their own website, anyway. It's your domain, do what you want. Well here's the important part: <b>these posts retain their ability to execute javascript even after being reblogged. So that annoying alert box <i>actually propogates to any unsuspecting follower</i></b>. For Wordpress.org blogs (self-hosted Wordpress instances), this isn't as big of a problem; however, on Wordpress.com and on Tumblr, the additional community features like reblogging and a discovery feed allows malicious content to spread extremely quickly and reach people who never directly opted-in to see it.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Which means you could imagine writing a script that waits to execute - a "sleeper", if you will. Maybe you post a picture of a cat - the HTML content doesn't actually show up in the blog post (or the reblog interface, for that matter) - and set a timer for a week from today. No one knows any better, they think they're reblogging a kitten in a bunny costume. Then boom. Everyone's background picture is suddenly your worst enemy's baby photo.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Other things we found out you could do: while jQuery doesn't work (we didn't try including google's hosted library), you can still select DOM nodes using traditional javascript. For all you non-coders out there, that basically gives you the ability to manipulate the underlying HTML. So let's try something slightly more advanced:
          <div class="code">
            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            <div class="code-indent">document.getElementById("header").children[0].innerHTML = "&lt;div class='title-group animate' style='text-align: center'&gt;&lt;h1&gt;HELLO TUMBLR DO YOU MISS YOUR BACKGROUND PHOTO??? TOO BAD.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"</div>
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </div>
          What does this one do? It replaces all the HTML content on a particular DOM node with whatever I want. So in this case, I replaced the header with some obnoxious text.
        </div>

        <div class="image"><img src="assets/img/tumblr_2.png" /></div>

        <div class="paragraph">
         You can even modify Tumblr’s own javascript function definitions and object references. Essentially, by providing you access to scripts, you have the ability to manipulate not only the underlying HTML and CSS, but also the javascript that powers Tumblr’s frontend. So for example, if you include jQuery, you can do the following:
          <div class="code">
            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            <div class="code-indent">
            &lt;src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;<br>
            $(document).ready(function{
              <div class="code-indent">Tumblr = {};</div>
            })</div>
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </div>
          Other non-malicious things include creating style nodes and inserting styling on the fly, or just text nodes.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          So far, none of this goes beyond slightly annoying. And for good reason - this isn't really a post knocking on Tumblr, so we don't really want people to get all weird trying to break Tumblr. However, we just wanted to point out one of the most dangerous - and easiest to implement - applications of this bug: <i>phishing</i>.
          <div class="code">
            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            <div class="code-indent">window.open("http://charlesjin.com/security");</div>
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </div>
          Yes, pop-up blockers have progressed. But, you could still tie a click event to a particular element (or just reappropriate an existing link), and open a window that looks exactly like Tumblr, Gmail, etc.
        </div>
        <h2> Check Your Sources: iframes </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          But why stop there.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Javascript, sure. Just look for javascript tags, and replace the special XML characters needed for script tags <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> with their HTML escaped counterparts: <b>&amp;lt;</b> and <b>&amp;gt;</b>. Standard homework for any second-year CS course. That's easy. We should also note that, in the day we spent playing around, we didn't manage to get any of this behavior to show up in a user's feed. This means you'd have to navigate to the actual blog for this to happen.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          But what about iframes?
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <b>iframes are special HTML element that allow for inline embedding of other documents.</b> The way iframes are set up, you cannot interact with elements within the iframe from outside the iframe - it's usually blocked due to cross-domain safety concerns. Because what's in the iframe is literally content from another webpage, you shouldn't be allowed to embed someone else's content on your site, then manipulate it yourself.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <b>The story is different, though, if you control both the parent AND the child documents.</b> The idea is that the developer should be able to communicate between the two html documents - for example, a lot of websites will display "Are you sure you want to navigate to another domain?" as something of a security check when clicking links (Exhibit A: Youtube). If you implement this via pop-up, you might want to know what the user clicks client-side as opposed to server-side (don't worry if that didn't make sense to you).
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          With this in mind, I tried to send a basic message from outside the iframe into the iframe. The following set up will send the message "hi" to the iframe upon clicking the header element of the tumblr - i.e. the section where the background image was until I replaced it. Inside the iframe, the message "hi" will display as the heading. To reproduce, make a video post, and in the embed section, put the following code:
          <div class="code">
          &lt;iframe id="test" width="560" height="315" src="//www.charlesjin.com/test" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          </div>
          Now in the body of the actual post, put this in:
          <div class="code">
            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            <div class="code-indent">document.getElementById("header").addEventListener('click', function(e){alert("click!"); document.getElementById('test').contentWindow.postMessage ('hi', '*')}, false);</div>
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </div>
          We've bound an event to the header section - to be specific, a "click". <b>Now, every time a "click" event is detected on the header, the parents frame - i.e. Tumblr - will send a message to the DOM element with ID "test".</b> Luckily, our iframe was set up exactly with this ID. 
        </div>

        <div class="image"><img src="assets/img/tumblr_3.png" /></div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          FInally, to recieve this message, I have on my webpage
          <div class="code">
            &lt;script&gt;<br>
            <div class="code-indent">window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);<br>
            function receiveMessage(event){
            <div class="code-indent">$("h1").append(event.data);</div>
            };</div>
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </div>
          This sets the page up to listen for messages being sent to it. (Note: if you choose implementing this for your own purposes, you should actually check to make sure the event is being fired from a trusted domain by calling event.origin. Also never send messages with the wildcard target origin.)
        </div>

        <div class="image"><img src="assets/img/tumblr_4.gif" /></div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Using this, someone can theoretically intercept <i>everything that happens</i> on your tumblr page, send it to their own site, and save it in their database.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          The scary part is there really isn't a good solution to this problem. <b>Because iframes originate from a different domain, there isn't much you can do to police what people will do from within iframes</b>. This means you can embed whatever malicious javscript you want - open a new window, phish, etc. - without any safeguards. The one caveat is you can't interact directly with the DOM, but that's barely an incovenience...
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          The best solution we've seen to this problem is how Facebook handles media in their newsfeed. Facebook has a whitelist of services for which they choose to render in-line media. For example, if you post a Youtube link, Facebook will add new div to your post, which is binded on click to make an AJAX call to pull up the Youtube iframe. Other services that have this special inline embed privelege include Soundcloud, Spotify, and Vimeo. Non-whitelisted services will just open in a new window, thereby preventing cross-domain scripting attacks
        </div>
        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          This is by means no mean a condemnation of Tumblr and Wordpress exclusively. They just happened to be two of the sites with the largest user base, and hopefully they can disseminate the message further. We don't really have the time right now to go searching down every instance of a site that allows embedded HTML. Allowing styling on webpages is fine, so long as some sanitization function nukes all script tags before the message is posted. It's either that, or anything goes.
